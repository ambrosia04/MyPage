           You found me! Welcome to the quiet place between the trees. <br>
            I’m a software engineer, but also something of a puzzle-solver at heart. <br><br>
            I like to take things apart, understand how they work, and put them back together cleaner than before <br>(sometimes in code, sometimes in life). <br>

            I’m curious by nature, meticulous by instinct, and happiest when I’m building something thoughtful. <br>
<br>
            Fun fact: I love animals, forests, and the kind of silence you can only hear when the wind is the only thing talking. <br>
            If I could debug code under a tree, I absolutely would.
